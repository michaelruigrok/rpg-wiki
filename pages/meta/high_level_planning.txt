====== High Level Session Planning =======
These higher level planning techniques can be very useful if you are stuck for how to progress your adventure next, but can be a major timesink. It can often be more efficient just to go with something, and play off how your players react. Balance, as always, is key.

===== Goals =====
   * What do you want to happen by the end of the session?
   * What value should your session offer?
   * What general 
   * What do you want your players to experience or feel during the session?

===== Focal Elements =====
   * Develop parts of your session based on what your goals are
   * What properties should the session have to help you achieve your goals?
   * Aesthetics, tropes, environments, characterisations

===== Format and Structure =====
   * Time allocation, both within this session and other sessions
   * General pacing
     * Set up acts or general portions of the session
   * What major plot points or climaxes do you want your session to have?
   * While it is not generally a good idea to railroad the course of the game, it can be a good idea to identify key events which will occur over the session no matter that the players do
     * In order to speed up or slow down (by adding helpful tools/hints or extra challenges), you need to know what structure you generally want.
     * Work forwards and backwards from these events to develop possible scenarios and ways things might play out. Instead of developing a 'plan', develop a 'toolbox' of outcomes to allow you to build on the actions of your players.
