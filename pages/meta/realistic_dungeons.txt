====== Dungeon Design ======

===== Describing Rooms =====
Start with establishing info, things that describe the mood, and finish with interactive elements.

* Room size and dimensions
* Light and Light sources.
* Visible Doors and Exits. (Including stairs).
* Large objects. (Pillars, Dias, Pedestals, Statues,  Pit, Chasm, Stream, Lava).
* Furniture. ( Tables, Chairs, Cabinets, Torture Implements )
* you want to go further 

Don't forget other senses of each thing:
* Sounds, smell, feel, temperature,
* Is anything overwhelming, hard to notice


===== Realistic Dungeons =====
==== Old Structures ====
While increasing the age of a dungeon can be an easy way to add to the atmosphere and intrigue of a dungeon, doing so limits the dungeon's potential contents. When designing old dungeons, keep in mind elements that change over time:
  * Wood rotting away
  * Fungus, moss and plant growths
