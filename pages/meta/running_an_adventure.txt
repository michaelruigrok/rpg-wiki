====== Running an Adventure ======

===== Introducing narrative hooks =====
==== Starting Environments ====
  * Players can generate a sensible reason why a party would assemble according to their backstories
  * Have an adventurers guild that the adventurers are all part of
  * Have a town event or similar to which they take part in
    * Tournaments
    * Festivals
  * Stuck in a isolated location, like in transport. Or in gaol!

==== The Catalyst for the Adventure ====
  * A planned activity or task goes pear-shaped
  * A shady character comes into the mix who might be chased for information
  * Similarly, gossip of a odd or strange occurrence causes unease
  * A group of miscreants suddenly attack
  * One character must recruit the rest of the party for a mission they already have
