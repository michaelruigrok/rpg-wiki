===== Geography and Points of Interest =====
Gargreen is split into vague sections defined from the town's expansion and evolution. Older establishments essential to a young town sit to the south (containing old merchant housing, poorer dense housing, and pioneer farmland), and newer, auxillary buildings to the north.

==== Southern Gargreen ====
The southeast has a very long history, and many of the outskirting farms are still held by their original families, but housing closer to the centre has shifted over the years and is currently seen as the poorer part of town.
