====== The Old Guild =======
The Old Guild was the version of the [[Barreyon Adventurer's Guild]] that disbanded about 100 years ago.


===== Disbandment and the Guild's Final Plan =====
The Old Guild believed they were not strong enough in both numbers and power in order to defeat the greatest evil of The West. Many great heroes had perished during the quest, and while exploring The West due to their lack of preparedness for the heightening threats The West threw at them. If they tried to take on the evil and were defeated, it would be released onto the world with nobody to stop it.

Instead, the old guild enacted a plan to place a seal on the evil, freezing its advance rather than defeating it. This would allow a fresh generation of potential heroes to rise from the population. This new generation could then make use of the knowledge and resources the Old Guild had accrued over their adventures, to prevent the new group from making the same mistakes. At the very least, the new generation could re-apply the seal which was necessary to contain the evil for the next generation once more.

To assist with this plan, the Old Guild also cast a powerful enchantment across the whole land. The enchantment diminished chaos and promoted law, decreasing the chance that heroes would put themselves in peril (as a result of war, natural threats, or their own adventurousness, etc.) until the time was right.

===== Old Guild Dungeons =====
The Old Guild created a series of dungeons to assist the adventurer's towards their final goal. The dungeons provide the group with valuable magical equipment, and opportunities to foster the kind of teamwork, resourcefulness, thinking, and emotional resolve that will be needed if they are ever to have chance of defeating the great evil. 

The dungeons are also a method to test the guild, to ensure they are strong enough and prepared enough for the just the next section of The West, or at least how it was before 100 years of change. The Old Guild were careful to ensure the dungeons were challenging, without causing unnecessary harm or death to the new generation. 

The dungeons are also designed to test the moral alignment of the group, to ensure they are on a path of using their power for good. Giving dangerous magical strength to evil-doers would be grave mistake indeed, one that could hasten the end of the world instead of preventing it.

==== The First Dungeon ====
The first dungeon was designed with piquing the interest of the group, to get them invested in the wonders of The West. At this stage, not much of the guild can be tested, especially not the moral compass of the group -- power must be given to the group before their true mettle is revealed. The dungeon offers mysterious treasures, the power of which can only be revealed by continuing their adventure into The West.

The entrance of the dungeon is a small trapdoor, plainly on the ground. It has a golden ring knocker to lift it up by, and is crafted from dark, weathered wood and a solid metal trim around its border. It requires a strength check of 18 to open, with at least two individuals lifting it. Consecutive attempts without changing technique will always fail (unless roll was 2 off last time).

The first room of the dungeon attempts to send a clear message. It is a wide, short corridor with a chest at the end. In between the chest and the players is a small crevasse, about 3.5 metres in length (DC 14). When the chest is opened, a secret door to their right opens up. The chest itself contains a series of treasure, as well as a short sword with an ornate handle.

The next room contains a more direct challenge. An obvious door, magical in nature, stands behind two automaton skeletons, constructed from wood. Both have wooden weapons, one a sizable shield and longsword, which it swings wildly. If the party has trouble with both, one will back off until the other is defeated. Arrows do little against, mostly bouncing off, while cutting hand hitting weapons do well (when they hit perpendicular).

One puzzle in the middle of the dungeon tests the party's knowledge of Barreyon. Knowledge of the Old Guild is necessary for the group to begin their journey. There are three levers, each with an animal pasted above it -- a badger, a wolf, and an eagle. This is possibly a nod to the Skyrim lever-pull puzzle. Pulling the Eagle lever shall open the door, but pulling the other levers shall cause the water level to rise. Levers take a firm pull and a couple of seconds to turn, so one can only just switch the first lever off, and the second lever on, in time. 

This puzzle should hint the players in to the fact that the dungeon has been crafted by the Old Guild. In an adjacent room, a poem sits on the wall, an ode to the Old Guild's centre of operations, //The Crooked Eagle//:

The end of the dungeon features a door leading to the rest of the caves. The architecture goes through a distinct change from the smooth, rectangular bricks of the dungeon to the bumpy, round rooms of the natural caves.
