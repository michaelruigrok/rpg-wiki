====== The Old Guild =======
The Old Guild was the version of the [[Barreyon Adventurer's Guild]] that disbanded about 100 years ago.


===== Disbandment and the Guild's Final Plan =====
The Old Guild believed they were not strong enough in both numbers and power in order to defeat the greatest evil of The West. Many great heroes had perished during the quest, and while exploring The West due to their lack of preparedness for the heightening threats The West threw at them. If they tried to take on the evil and were defeated, it would be released onto the world with nobody to stop it.

Instead, the old guild enacted a plan to place a seal on the evil, freezing its advance rather than defeating it. This would allow a fresh generation of potential heroes to rise from the population. This new generation could then make use of the knowledge and resources the Old Guild had accrued over their adventures, to prevent the new group from making the same mistakes. At the very least, the new generation could re-apply the seal which was necessary to contain the evil for the next generation once more.

To assist with this plan, the Old Guild also cast a powerful enchantment across the whole land. The enchantment diminished chaos and promoted law, decreasing the chance that heroes would put themselves in peril (as a result of war, natural threats, or their own adventurousness, etc.) until the time was right.

===== Old Guild Dungeons =====
The Old Guild created a series of dungeons to assist the adventurer's towards their final goal. The dungeons provide the group with valuable magical equipment, and opportunities to foster the kind of teamwork, resourcefulness, thinking, and emotional resolve that will be needed if they are ever to have chance of defeating the great evil. 

The dungeons are also a method to test the guild, to ensure they are strong enough and prepared enough for the just the next section of The West, or at least how it was before 100 years of change. The Old Guild were careful to ensure the dungeons were challenging, without causing unnecessary harm or death to the new generation. 

The dungeons are also designed to test the moral alignment of the group, to ensure they are on a path of using their power for good. Giving dangerous magical strength to evil-doers would be grave mistake indeed, one that could hasten the end of the world instead of preventing it.

==== The First Dungeon ====
The first dungeon was designed with piquing the interest of the group, to get them invested in the wonders of The West. At this stage, not much of the guild can be tested, especially not the moral compass of the group -- power must be given to the group before their true mettle is revealed. The dungeon offers mysterious treasures, the power of which can only be revealed by continuing their adventure into The West.
