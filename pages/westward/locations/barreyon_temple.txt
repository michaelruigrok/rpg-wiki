====== Barreyon Temple ======
The temple is the primary repository of books, although its library is minimal. Priests have knowledge of magic items and herbs, and have some capacity for potionmaking. The temple also has a hospital, where they take care of the infirm and sick.

The temple has four major sections:
  * A meeting courtyard, with benches forming a circle shape
  * The main hall, with a variety of benches facing a collection of shrines. The major shrines stand in the centre of the front stage, while the minor shrines line the back walls.
  * The library, housed in a built-on extension to the left, made from the same stone as the rest of the building.
  * The hospital, housed in a similar extension (except newer and wooden) to the right.

The temple has shrines for the following gods:

===== Major Shrines =====
  * [[pfw>Erastil]]
  * [[pfw>Gozreh]]

The major shrines take the form of large abstract sculptures of angled and smooth shapes twisting upwards.

===== Minor Shrines =====
  * [[pfw>Pharasma]]
  * [[pfw>Irori]]
  * [[pfw>Desna]]
  * [[pfw>Sarenrae]]
  * [[pfw>Iomedae]]

Minor shrines are small engraved altars along each of the wall, featuring the holy symbol of each god.

The shrine to [[pfw>Cayden Cailean]] is in //[[The Crooked Eagle]]//. The temple has had rowdy patrons in the past, and after a few situations it was moved.

| 23 | **The Story of Graye**: The story of a slave forced to be a pit-fighter who turned to meditation as an escape from his violent life. This book is not well written, and is probably an earlier work of a novice author that never reached wide spread fame.
