====== Ravine and Near Woods ======
The Near woods are the section of woods just beyond the Barreyon Ravine. The area on the [[Barreyon]] side of the ravine is referred as the //Barreyon Woods//.

===== Ravine =====
At the main crossing of the ravine --- where the original bridge is --- it is 20m wide and 25m down. Throwing a 70ft rope usually requires a weight on one end to get it over.

The original bridge from [[The Old Guild]] has since fallen apart. The bridge falls 60% of the way down on the east side, and 20% on the other side. The east side has a panel broken on the bridge half-way down the ravine.

Just in front of the bridge, a sign crafted from a branch and some bark reads:
> Rope Crossing to the other side of ravine, in light of broken bridge. Erected by Groford.

Tory, Melody and Groford placed three ropes to assist movement across:
  * On Barreyon's side, a rope is tied to the bottom of the bridge, and reaches about 2 metres from the bottom. 
  * On the other side, the rope is tied to one of the bridge posts, and reaches down into the water. 
  * Two pitons hold a rope between each side of the water.

Just left of the bridge on Barreyon's side, a large tree trunk leans from the top of the ravine down into the water, about 40% (8m) across. It was cut down by Ephraim and Macie at the request of Kesil to create a makeshift bridge.

About 40 metres south from the bridge, there is a hole in the side of the ravine.

===== Goblin village =====
The goblin tribe have a camp somewhere in the forest. 
Lead by a brain-damaged bugbear who speaks in a low, calm voice. Faux elder voice, I guess. 
The tribe have regular hunting parties, and use the traps left by the old guild
Is possible that, after a few goblins are killed, the rest of them run away. This leaves the bugbear as a single battle

Goblin hunting parties seldom go near the bear's territory. The goblins see the bear as a big, more dangerous dog, which fuels their hatred for it.
