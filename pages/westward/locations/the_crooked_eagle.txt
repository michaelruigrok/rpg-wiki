====== The Crooked Eagle ======
{{ :westward:crooked-eagle.png?400| The Crooked Eagle Interior}}
The Crooked Eagle is the main tavern and town hall of [[Barreyon]].

It is owned by [[westward:characters:Galus]], a cheery, very short mer who could be mistaken for a halfling. His co-workers are Mildred, a barkeep, and Nathan, a bartending understudy.

The bar has a warm atmosphere, helped by the torches that line the walls, and the wooden furniture and structure. Despite this, the roof is rather high.

The back left contains stairs that lead up to the second level, which is in comparison very cramped.

The bar often has a band playing, On a stage on the far end of the hall. 
 
The back right leads into an extended room which protrudes from the rest of the building, where the kitchen is positioned.
