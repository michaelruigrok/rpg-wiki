====== Wesbond ======
Wesbond (literally west boundary) is a relatively large city, the closest to [[Barreyon]]. It’s a full day’s travel away, requiring travellers to depart at dawn and arrive at sundown.

Due to the expanding population and the natural barrier around town of [[westward:Westward World and Regions#The Opaque Night]], the town has begun building up instead of out.

Wesbond is more of a corporation than a city, where almost everyone is a civil servant. The city is run by a board of directors.

Work ethic is a central value of the city - being a worker as part of the city is a great honour and highly valued position; an important cog in the complex and great Wesbond machine. And this is for great reason. Wesbond relies on the enormous output of its citizens; without the city could never support itself.

As part of this communal work, the social services of the town are surprising good. Large scale efforts are attempted to at least give a minimal amount of food to those in need. Despite this, there is a massive imbalance of owned wealth, and living conditions vary widely based on the city.

Due to the amount of impotent race couples, adoption rates are very high, and the city puts in a lot of work to ensure each orphan is placed in a family, to maintain the values of work in the family unit.

However, the adoption system restricts vertical movement between class. Rather than adopting, the rich will commission children from other aristocratic couples in order to maintain the 'purity' of their family line. For certain discriminated races, they can often find themselves locked out of the system. Additionally, individuals outside of a family unit cannot make use of the social services such as food hand-outs.

Mer are dually perceived in Wesbond, In the lower classes, they are shunned for their alien nature. However, they are seen as a very noble race by the Aristocracy. They are able to interbreed with other races, without giving birth to a half-race.
