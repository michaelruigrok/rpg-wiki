===== Actual Events =====
Louisa's body was taken by [[westward:characters:Brianna]] and her accomplice [[westward:characters:Wallace]], to continue her research into death and undeath.

To assist her carrying the body over the ravine, Brianna used levitate just above the water to transport the body over the ravine (assuming the bridge was broken when she did so).
