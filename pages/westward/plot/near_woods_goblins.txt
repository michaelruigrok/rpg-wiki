====== Near Woods Goblins ======

====== Before the Guild ======
The tribe of Goblins in the near woods have lived in their settlement for the past few decades, For years, there was horrendous in-fighting in the community, with constant factions and mutinees and leadership overthrowals. The village was never larger than 10 members, and resource management, housing, role organisation, and living standards all suffered. No one was in leadership long enough to build up experience for the role, the goblins would become disgruntled at the job they were doing, uprisings would start, and the cycle would continue.

Then, one day, a mysterious individual wandered into town. A bugbear, Stealk, from the raiding pockets in the Downcrest Hills. He was once a noted warrior, known for his large bulking size, until a life-changing accident severely damaged the back of his head. Left for dead by his raiding party, and very concussed, he wandered east towards the near woods. 

The head injury change Stealk's mind forever. He lost all of his previous identity, memories and personality. The animalistic and violent nature which is central to a bugbear was destroyed, leaving the rational frontal cortex to handle all the work.
