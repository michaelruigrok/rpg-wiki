====== Near Woods Goblins ======

===== Before the Guild =====
The tribe of Goblins in the near woods have lived in their settlement for the past few decades, For years, there was horrendous in-fighting in the community, with constant factions and mutinies and leadership overthrowals. The village was never larger than 10 members, and resource management, housing, role organisation, and living standards all suffered. No one was in leadership long enough to build up experience for the role, the goblins would become disgruntled at the job they were doing, uprisings would start, and the cycle would continue.

Then, one day, a mysterious individual wandered into town. A bugbear, Stealk, from the raiding pockets in the Downcrest Hills. He was once a noted warrior, known for his large bulking size, until a life-changing accident severely damaged the back of his head. Left for dead by his raiding party, and very concussed, he wandered east towards the near woods. 

The head injury change Stealk's mind forever. He lost all of his previous identity, memories and personality. The animalistic and violent nature which is central to a bugbear was destroyed, leaving the rational frontal cortex to handle all the work.

Noticing Stealk's common heritage and towering size, the goblin village took quickly to their new visitor as worthy of respect. His distinguishing features and calm, wise demeanour easily set him apart as an authority figure, known from then on as 'Chief Chief'.

Chief Chief's leadership wasn't amazingly better than that of the goblins, he was heavily brain-damaged after all. But his undisputed authority meant their were much less in-fighting. Goblins lived long enough to gain expertise in areas, bringing them up into assistant leadership roles.  

===== Early Encounters =====
Since the goblin village is relatively far away from the ravine, the first player interaction with the goblins were through hunting parties that move through the woods. In such interactions, goblins are usually bloodthirsty and quick to violence.

However, the adventurers found Goblin outposts before seeing the goblin's themselves.

===== Injured Goblin Dog =====
The first outpost found by the adventures was a cave housing an injured Goblin Dog.

===== Adventurer's Finding Goblin Dog & Goblins =====
[[westward:characters:Kesil Cailean]], [[westward:characters:Korlan Ferreira]], [[westward:characters:Zaffre Avalon]] and [[westward:characters:Ox Virium]] were the first to find the injured goblin dog cave. Outside the cave, two Goblin Dogs were tied up to a post, and would ferociously attack anything that came close enough. Noting their aggression, the party decided to kill to dogs to safely enter the cave. Zaffre disposed of the bodies away from the cave, down towards the main path, leaving the ropes attached to the post.

Inside the cave was an injured Goblin Dog, lying on a dirty pile of hay. It had the skin and flesh on its side completely torn off, exposing its internals. Kesil attempted to treat the dog, fetching a medical [[westward:world:resonite]] ointment from [[westward:locations:Barreyon Temple]], and applying it under a makeshift bandage from Kesil's undershirt. Promising himself to heal the injured dog, Kesil decided to travel to Wesbond to get more ointment.. Over the next week, Kesil strove to heal the Goblin Dog, and decided  travelling to Wesbond to get medical ointment for its wounds.

In the meantime, [[westward:characters:Tory]], [[westward:characters:Melody Fiddle|Melody]] and [[westward:characters:Groford]] met the goblins Eyeball, the War Chief's son, and Ratters, riding on the Goblin Dog Grahn.
  * While the goblins went into the encounnter with violent intent, Melody took them off-guard. Instead of drawing a weapon or getting out of the way of Grahn's charge. She stood her ground, stuck out her hand and yelled out 'Stop!'.
  * By tricking the goblins into thinking Melody possessed powerful magic, she convinced the goblins to stay back 
  * Furthermore, she turned the scenario on its head, offering the goblins her "magic fire-bearing device" (a lantern).

The goblins were astounded by the seeming magical treatment of the injured goblin dog.

Since the goblin dogs often escaped, and would come back after a couple of days, the goblins thought not too much of it.

However, the delay in time that travelling to Wesbond took, and the fact the dead bodies were left uncovered in the middle of the woods, meant soon enough the goblins found the dead bodies of the dogs. before the party could do anything about it. The arrows stuck in their flesh told them that other intelligent beings had been in the forest. Given an opportunity to attack,  

Kesil returned from Wesbond with more ointment.

At this point, news of the goblins had reached into town, and there was major anxiety among the townspeople. In a large meeting at //The Crooked Eagle//, the party decided to venture out, intent on treating the injured Goblin Dog with the newly acquired ointment, and finding out more about the current situation.

Oolywere was on watch with Wocky, and were ambushed by Zaffre and Connor. While Wocky was shot and killed from behind, Oolywere was taken in for questioning. Horrified at his best friend's death, Oolywere escorts the party towards the Goblin Dog cave, and tells the goblins inside not to attack. Coincidentally, the goblins inside are Eyeball and Uptug, who already.

Knowing how dangerous the humans coming in were, and not wanting to risk goblins lives, the three decide the only way out is to meet the human's terms. 

Kesil, Ox, Zaffre and Korlan met
