====== Near Woods - Spider Sun Cave ======
The ground beneath the [[westward:locations:Near Woods|Near Woods]] features large sections of interlinking caves, with multiple entrances and exits dispersed throughout. This entrance is close to the Ravine, on the North side nearing Barreyon Lake.

Outside the cave entrance sits a large rounded obelisk. on the top and bottom it feature several horizontal circles carved into its surface. In the middle, a large icon is carved, appearing to be a cross between a spider and a sun.

===== Brianna's Hideout =====
=== 1: Entrance Cavern ===
The first room of this entrance is a wide cavern. Dark brown walls with slightly greyer patches, containing traces of Resonite. They are very rough, with nooks, crannies and holes covering their whole surface. 

On the bottom wall, a Fleckstone filter has been constructed from the dug out wall. It has been maintained by [[westward:characters:Brianna]], with a glass beaker at the bottom catching any remains.

On first visit, a pile of scissors and dirty bandages from [[westward:plot:Louisa Henchfifth's Missing Body|Louisa Henchfifth]] which she used to secure its wrappings when taking it over the ravine. They've also been used while dissecting the body, and thus have blood on them. 

=== 2: Alcove & Crevice ===
One end of the cavern thins out into a passageway to a little alcove, curving out both left and right. 

On the left is a cedar barrel with a sealed lid. It contains Phalo-aldehide, a viscious light-grey liquid used to disinfect and preserve biological material. On skin, it begins to tingle after a few seconds, transitioning into a burn which continually gets worse.

On the right of the alcove sits Louisa Henchfifth's corpse, covered in its large cloth wrapping. The Phalo-aldehide has been applied to her skin, leaving it blackened, and pumped through her arteries. However, the chemical has caused her internals and skin to remain with the same texture and physicality as if they were alive.

The back of the corpse has been cut open and some ribs have been removed. Brianna has performed some kind of changes to her back, but the untrained eye could not determine what.

Past the alcove is a thin Crevice, which leads to a wooden door. The door is make of thick wooden planks. The planks have cracks in between that can be seen through, but have been magically treated so nothing but darkness is visible, even for those with darkvision. Once the door is open, the golden light that bathes the next room comes through its opening (but not the cracks).

=== 3: Desnan Fountain ===
Compared to the last room, this room has been artificially dug out. It contains a fountain, identical to that found within the Black Fang Dungeon from Paizo's Beginner Box.

If water is removed from the fountain and mixed with the Phalo-aldehyde from the other room, the mixture begins to spark where they touch, but the two do not mix until the light has faded. If Phalo-aldehyde is poured directly into the fountain, it will spark much more violently, splashing water and the preservative everywhere.

When Korlan put his sword into the fountain, Desna reacted to the three scratches on his sword as a sign of devotion to Chaldira, blessing the sword for the rest of the day. This caused it to glow a golden light, like the fountain.
