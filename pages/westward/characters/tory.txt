Tory is the co-owner of the Barreyon Wrestling Ring, along with a group of his colleagues. He often acts as an announcer and referee.

===== Family =====
Tory has a wife and two children. His children, aged 2 and 7 respectively, loved wrestling, and were the ones who got him to invest in the ring on the first place. 

Tory has a father who lives in Wesbond, who in the past struggled with an alcohol addiction. He has managed to overcome his addiction, and is now a wise and noble man who works as an inventor.

Tory also has four siblings of similar age to him. Two of them live in Wesbond with his father, and two live close by in Barreyon.

===== Personality =====
Growing up with an alcoholic and frequently violent father taught Tory how to defuse the anger of others, as well as assist those who are struggling with mental illness. 

Outside of a controlled sporting environment, Tory is extremely opposed to violence. By working as a referee, Tory is able to draw a distinct line between respectful competition and malicious or unsportsmanlike behaviour.

Tory does not like it when people ridicule his height.
