===== Personality =====
Melody is a greatly curious person who loves to travel and discover in order to bring people together. Despite this, Melody is often shy and at times awkward, which can often make her goals difficult to achieve.

===== Appearance =====
Melody has long, bushy auburn hair, and often finds herself with worn clothes from her adventuring.

===== Before the Guild =====
Melody was brought up by an old traveler, whose name she never learnt. By the age of 8, she found herself alone, and began to search for a family to take care of her. She has long given up this hope, and now strives to discover beauty, and make the people she meets happy.
