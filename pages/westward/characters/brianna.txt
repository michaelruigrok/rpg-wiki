Brianna used to work as an engineer at the Carvehook mines until a supernatural incident regarding a dead minor caused her to become interested in necromantic magic. She now lives in Barreyon, striving to recreate the incident while keeping her less than socially acceptable experiments hidden from the public.

Brianna is cautious of members of the adventurer's guild, who have encroached on the near west where she conducts her research. She assumes the bridge was cut down to prevent her from making it across the ravine, thinking the guild have made steps to find out her identity.

Brianna has the greatest magical knowledge out of everyone in Barreyon. This makes her incredibly useful to the guild, if they can accept her morally-grey actions.

Her husband used to work with her in the Carvehook mines, but moved to work as an elite appraiser/jeweler in Wesbond when she Brianna to Barreyon. It is rumored that she stays in Barreyon to have an affair with her necromatic accomplice, [[Wallace]], and the relationship between Brianna and her husband is on the rocks. However, this is not the case. Her husband is aware of her necromatic research, and assists her by working a well-paying job where he can use the research resources that Wesbond features but Barreyon lacks.

===== Personality =====
While Brianna can get easily flustered during uncomfortable social interactions, she is a strong-willed and resourceful individual. Her curiosity often gets the better of her, even in situations where she might put herself in danger. For the most part, she is independent and keeps to herself.

===== Appearance =====
Brianna is a blonde, curly-haired halfling with a strong Welsh accent.


===== Life in Barreyon =====

===== Before The Guild =====
Brianna grew up in the centre of [[westward:locations:Vahrenhelm]]. Her mother was a working-class half-orc who worked in the [[westward:locations:Vahrenhelm mines]], while her halfling father was a high-class academic at the Vahrenhelm university. As such, Brianna grew a passion for both the sciences and the mining industry from a very young age. In her 20's, Brianna worked tirelessly to improve the health and safety conditions in the mines, although her work went unnoticed by the public, most miners have heard of her and hold her in high regard.

Until recently, she worked at [[westward:locations:Carvehook Mines]], helping innovate dwarven mine architecture to improve the ventilation systems in place. 

At some point, a diamond miner got into a catastrophic accident. When the body was recovered for autopsy, Brianna discovered their heart was still beating, which it continued to do even when she removed it.
