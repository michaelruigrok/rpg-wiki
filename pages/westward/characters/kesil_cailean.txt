Kesil is a hunter who has lived in Barreyon for a while before the guild started. The Only friend he trusts is Raoul, his trusty dog.

===== Personality =====

===== Appearance =====

===== Relationships =====
==== Hosef Fulstenn ====
Hosef farms on the east outskirts of town. He raises a small herd of cows and
chickens, supplying eggs and milk to the town. Kesil worked and stayed at the
farm before buying a house.

The pair regularly mix up the names of each others' animals.

I need to make an individual page for Hosef, but he's hopelessly in love with
a part time worker in the bar, but cannot work up the courage to talk to them.

===== Before the Guild =====
==== Upbringing ====

==== Moving to Barreyon ====
When Kesil first arrived in Barreyon, he worked for Hosef Fulstenn, hunting
the predators that preyed on his farm animals. To this day the pair are good
friends and trade goods frequently.

Kesil lived on the farm before purchasing his house.
