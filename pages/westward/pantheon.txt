====== Pantheon ======
For the most part, the _Westward_ pantheon follows that of Pathfinder, but with tweaks and changes that naturally arise from worldbuilding and play.

The biggest change to the Pathfinder Pantheon is that Deities are never represented directly as people. unless they [[pfw>Ascension|ascended]] from a previous humanoid form. Another exception is Shelyn, who is depicted as beauty in all its forms.

===== Irori =====

===== Desna =====
Being the Goddess of freedom, travel and exploration, [[pfw>Desna]] holds a certain importance to Barreyon and The Guild. Shrines in her honour can be found all throughout The West, often in its furthest reaches,marking the achievements of adventurers as holy offerings.

===== Curchanus =====
Although [[pfw>Curchanus]], his legacy is incredibly important in the current state of The West. It is arguable that the very presence of The West as a wild ecosystem of adventure and exploration.

Curchanus held power to another, unknown domain. However, his death took the domain and its effects on the mortal realm with him.
