======= Character Bios ======
This is a collection of character bios, written in the second person. They are intended as chunks of information about the characters that the rest of the players might not know. They can be texted/messaged to a player in order to inform them, such that they can play off this information in character, without spoiling it for the other players.

===== Dawson =====
Dawson runs the general store, which sells all the items that don't have a specialist salesperson in town. If he doesn't have an item in stock, you can request that he order it from Wesbond, and he'll have it delivered in a week in normal circumstances.

Despite his chipper outward appearance, you have heard he spends a great deal of his time caring for his gravely ill father.
